# VictronWebApp

No license,
this is a personal project that i plan on keeping entirely open source and free for everyone to use / copy / anything they wish to do with it

it takes data from a mqtt server, you can find 100 and 1 different version of it on github,
the simplest way to get it going is to spin up a ubuntu 18.04 vm and pass throught a bluetooth adapter to it.

this system is not very generic at the moment, i plan on making it much more dynamic in the future 
but it's a very nice base as is to work off of.
